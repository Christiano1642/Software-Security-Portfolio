### Artemis Financial Summary

**Client Overview**:
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that required an assessment of their software security to protect sensitive client data and financial information. The companyâ€™s software needed to be refactored to integrate secure communication mechanisms and ensure compliance with modern security standards.

**Software Requirements**:
Artemis Financial needed to add a file verification step to its web application to ensure secure communications, specifically implementing a checksum verification using a cryptographic hash algorithm. Additionally, they required the conversion of their web communications from HTTP to HTTPS to secure data transmission.

### Software Security and Vulnerability Assessment

**Success in Identifying Vulnerabilities**:
I was successful in identifying and addressing the software security vulnerabilities by implementing secure coding protocols, such as adding AES encryption and enabling HTTPS. It is crucial to code securely to protect sensitive data, maintain client trust, and ensure compliance with industry regulations. Secure software adds significant value to a company by preventing data breaches and safeguarding its reputation.

**Challenges and Learning**:
The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was ensuring that no new vulnerabilities were introduced during the refactoring process. This required careful analysis and testing, particularly with the use of the Dependency-Check tool. However, this challenge was also a valuable learning experience, helping me to understand the intricacies of secure coding.

### Enhancing Security Layers

**Increasing Layers of Security**:
To increase layers of security, I implemented multiple measures, including encryption, secure communication protocols, and checksum verification. In the future, I would use a combination of static and dynamic analysis tools to assess vulnerabilities and employ threat modeling techniques to decide on the most effective mitigation strategies.

**Ensuring Functionality and Security**:
To ensure that the code and software application were both functional and secure, I conducted thorough testing after refactoring. This included running the refactored code to check for errors and performing a secondary dependency check to verify that no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

### Tools, Resources, and Best Practices

**Resources and Tools**:
During this project, I utilized tools such as Java Keytool for certificate generation, Dependency-Check for static code analysis, and the SHA-256 algorithm for checksum verification. These tools, along with industry-standard coding practices, will be invaluable in future assignments or tasks.

**Showcasing Work to Employers**:
To demonstrate my skills to potential employers, I would showcase this project as an example of my ability to identify and mitigate software vulnerabilities, implement secure coding practices, and ensure the secure operation of a software application. This artifact highlights my proficiency in both technical skills and the practical application of security principles in software development.
